# Siemens Time Series Forecasting

## Introduction

As any big company that operates in the global market, Siemens deals with many different areas of business and with many products and it realised that, to have a superior performance overall, it is important to be an organized company in every area. 
Following this goal, data was collected by the company in order to accomplish monthly sales predictions. These predictions (made using several algorithms depending on the product in question) will help the company be prepared for future changes as they will highlight moments of sales decrease and increase. This will make it easier for the company to take advantage of “good times” and grow while shedding light on more difficult months, allowing the staff to be prepared. These forecasting will also be useful to control inventory and personnel inside the company. 
With the analysis made it was possible to touch these points and others that will alert Siemens to more turbulent and also more shiny times in the next 10 months

## Conclusions

At the end of the analysis, it became clear how different each product is from one another and how they are affected by distinct factors. 
Forecasting proved to be a challenging task as the environment in which one is forecasting is always changing and sometimes it becomes impossible for a model to predict sales or any other metric correctly. This happens because many times models learn specific patters in the training set that are not repeated in the future due to explicit conditions present at the time of training. 
Fortunately, and although the data available was very much marked by the COVID-19 pandemic, the models used were able to provide good enough results that will be helpful identifying when the company needs to take a leap of faith and grow and when it should lay low. 
Another lesson, for forecasting, is that one shouldn't be anecdotal when selecting features and forecasting to the Smart Infrastructure departments. Hindsight will always be 2020 of course, but if a team relied on what previously worked at 2022-04, they would forecast wrong data that would put Siemens in further jeopardy (assuming COVID slowed down their operations). The key here is to forecast, not only with the key features of the past, but also having in mind what could be the important feature for the next months. In this case the Macros were important.
Overall, it became apparent that sometimes in forecasting, the most important thing is not to get as precise results as possible but a general view of the future that helps develop strategies to overcome hard times and thrive in a highly competitive market where it’s not always easy too keep up with the demands.
